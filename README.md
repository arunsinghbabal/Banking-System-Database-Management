# Banking System Database Management
This is a Bank Management System Database Project.

# Abstract: 
The main aim of the Bank Management Mini project is to keep record of customer transactions in the bank. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project. Firstly, customer registration is done in the concern bank branch and account number is provided to them. Afterwards, the customer can login into the bank account and update the personal details anytime. The customer can also check his/her previous transactions (debit and credit) and can take a soft copy of these transactions as a bank statement in the CSV format. To perform the debit and credit transactions in an account, a bank employee account is required. In addition to deposit or withdraw transaction, the employee is also authorized to close the bank account as per customer demand. <br />
